527874,Black Like Me,John Howard Griffin,"Griffin, John Howard",Robert Bonazzi,"=""0451192036""","=""9780451192035""",3,4.10,Signet,Mass Market Paperback,192,1996,1961,2020/11/08,2020/11/01,,,read,"After spotting this book in a second-hand bookstore, my initial curiosity quickly diminished when I understood the true premise of this story. ""What was it like, really like to be black in the Deep South"" - as told by a privileged white man dressed up in blackface in the 1950s. The idea is cringe-worthy and the audacious claims made on the cover of the novel like the quote above did not appeal to me. However, I quickly checked the ratings online which seemed to be overall quite positive. So I decided to give it a shot.<br/><br/>Griffin sets out to understand what life is like as a black man and after 6 weeks of dressing up as one and publishing his experience he is regarded as a spokesperson for black people. In this role as spokesperson he gets exclusive privilege into the black community where he continues his reporting to the white community well after the book is published. It is curious to me that it can take a member of an oppressive group to convince others of the same group that they are actively acting as oppressors. Who needed John Howard Griffin to be denied a restroom to understand the issue in such a denial to any other human?<br/><br/>Overall, I actually did find the narrative quite captivating. The story offers some tender moments depicting the author's loneliness during his experiment. Also, the kindness offered to him by complete strangers when he is invited into their homes to be fed and rested is very touching. However, for me, the author's epilogue which lacks a sincere reflection on the author's experiment does point to what I believe to be the true irony of the story. After the novel was published, Griffin became more visible in the civil rights movements of the 60s and was regularly invited to speak to communities about issues regarding race. During one of these meetings ""white community leaders"" seek guidance in Griffin to understand who do black people respect within their own communities. Griffin counsels that they should ""Ask black people - ask a lot of black people"". And so we see that the author sought to know what it was like to be a black person and in doing so ended up convincing plenty of people that he could advise on this topic. Yet in this quote alone he demonstrates that he is no expert on the experience of black people and that if you really want to know what it was like to be black in the Deep South then maybe try asking black people who lived during that time instead of John Howard Griffin.",,,1,0

Russell's long-term research in the field and his skill as a technical writer have positioned him to write a book that is quite accessible with a focus on questions regarding AI that feel most pertinent. He writes with an understanding of the history of AI that focuses on relevant developments pertaining to the likelihood of artificial general intelligence with a clarity that is not typical for a topic that is at the centre of current technology hype. Despite being able to lay out some abstract reasons for why current AI technologies will likely not create the problems we fear from a society controlled by powerful AI, he still strongly calls for the need to understand how to control increasingly ""intelligent"" AI. Despite the odd digression that I felt took away from some of the chapters, his proposals and examples are incredibly well thought out and deserve to be read and debated by a wide audience as AI increasingly creeps into more aspects of modern society.<br/>Additionally, the four appendices, which give a more thorough description of some of the ideas mentioned in the book were highly appreciated due to the author's skilled technical writing.",,,1,0

There is a superfluous attempt to make a lot of their stories overly dramatic, but this just results in dull personalities without much dept.<br/><br/>I felt Barrett was at best when giving himself more room to develop the character, such as with <i>Arm</i> in <i>Calm with Horses</i>. I could just as easily picture him acting awkwardly in the home of his ex lover as I could see him beating <i>Flannigan</i>, the perceived villain of the story.  Yet, like the rest of the book that novella is blanketed in hyperbole and might have been a bit more impressionable with a bit less drama.",,,1,0

I wonder if a computer develops consciousness would they find it as annoying as I did? Other than this nuisance, the book gives a great overview of the history and state of machine learning. The various subfields outlined in the novel are very well abstracted to show the significant similarities and differences between them.<br/><br/>However, Domingos' view of the future, as stated in the last chapter, wouldn't be the most inspiring. The possibility of an algorithm that could predict cancer treatment through genome mapping is surely an excellent use of machine learning but his belief that war will be ""fought"" by between different learners isn't something I'm looking forward to. The author assures the reader of this certainty. For me, this is just a stark reminder that technology advancement does not necessarily advance society in a positive way. In the case of fighting algorithms, there will be a victor and whomever or whatever possesses this technology will be the one with the power to rule a lot of important aspects in this world. This scenario just looks like a continuation of the current trend in the concentration of wealth and power into the hands of the few and not the many.",,,1,0

The field of Cyberpsychology is looking to describe the human behaviour driving the interactions between human and tech that are currently played out in this technology-drenched world. The number of interactions taking place is increasing at an incredible rate as new technology is introduced every day and people quickly adapt to using it as part of their day-to-day routine. These interactions can veer from the fairly mundane to completely bizarre. But what is important is that they are all affecting us as people and as a society. <br/><br/>This book invites the reader to step back from their screen and take a broad look at some of the changes to people that technology is causing.  Where the author fails is in trying to write about too many of these behaviours in too small a space. What results is a poorly structured piece of work that jumps erratically between interesting areas in the field that aren't explored in depth and are bound together by self-promoting anecdotes and annoying monologue. Nonetheless, very important issues are covered that should not be ignored.",,,1,0
